* I specialize in front-end development with a focus on React, bringing nearly four years of experience building clean, user-centred interfaces. 
* Iâ€™m passionate about modern web tech, great UX, and writing scalable, maintainable code.
* Some of my favorite front-end libraries include KonvaJS, AG Grid and Motion. 
* I'm interested in learning more about 3D front-end animation.
